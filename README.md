# loqui
This project aims to create a deep learning model that can accurately decipher lip movements and convert them into words.
The project uses a combination of computer vision and natural language processing techniques to achieve this goal.

# Dataset

# Preprocessing
The videos in the dataset are first preprocessed to extract the frames containing the lips. This is done using OpenCV and face detection algorithms to locate the face in each frame and then extract the lips from the face.
